# Tensorflow-GAN-Faces
A Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network for producing semi-realistic images of faces. The model uses WGAN loss with a gradient penalty. Written in Tensorflow 2.x


See the Jupyter notebook for the code, or you can run the code on a GPU for free in Google Colab using this [collaboratory link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rlronan/Tensorflow-GAN-Faces/blob/main/Tensorflow_WGAN_Faces.ipynb).
